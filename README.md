 Hi there 👋

I am a Software Engineer with 3.7+ years of experience, with a strong background in AI/ML, data-driven systems, and cloud-native development. I have previously worked at Amazon and recently completed an AI Automation Developer internship, where I built and deployed AI-powered solutions using Python and cloud technologies.

My experience includes working on scalable backend systems, machine learning pipelines, SQL-based analytics, and automation, along with collaborating closely with cross-functional engineering and business teams.

I am currently seeking full-time opportunities in Software Engineering, AI/ML Engineering, or Data-focused roles, where I can contribute to building impactful, production-grade systems while continuing to grow as an engineer.
